# SleepySurvey

Worked 8 hours so far

Decent UI
Center Text / Images
Data will be posted to Firebase in a JSON format

Experiment.js
If you click no, all subsequent no's will be checked
Check if all inputs are in and that there is a true before moving on 

Add ending price of each food to JSON

For pariticpation ID, how many digits / characters is it
Is there a standard dimension for the image? Should i scale it down if it gets too big

Check that there is a yes before next

Current issue is that when i push multiple no values to the yes array, it fucks up. 

I implemented an array of [0,0,0,0,0,0]

I am going to have to overwrite the value based on the position.

Instead of having to deal with all the hook bs, I am just going to update the hooks when i press submit. I will just be dealing with a constant value which will be much easier. Right now i just need to change th code to reflect this idea. FML
