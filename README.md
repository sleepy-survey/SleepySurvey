# SleepySurvey

Worked 15 hours so far

Data will be posted to Firebase in a JSON format

For pariticpation ID, how many digits / characters is it

onClick function is laggy

Back button issue

Since the user decline $5 in the previous section does the counter really need to go all the way up to 5?
